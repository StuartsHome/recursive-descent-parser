# recursive-descent-parser

## Overview
>The simplest way to build a parser.  
> A recursive descent parser is a top-down parser as it starts from the top or outermost grammar rule and works its way down into the nested subexpressions before finally reaching the leaves of the syntax tree.


> It’s called “recursive descent” because it walks down the grammar.

> In a top-down parser, you reach the lowest-precedence expressions first because they may in turn contain subexpressions of higher precedence.
